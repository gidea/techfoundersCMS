  title: WHY?
  description: >-
    We ourselves have found help and inspiration from those who came before us.
    Sadly, those structures don't exist anymore.


    While we were waiting for someone else to take their place, we realised that it is our mission to pay it forward.
description: We are an association established with the goal of providing help
  and support to the next wave of entrepreneurs. We start and run projects as a
  cooperation, were we see a need and we have vision to make this better. Of
  course, like any organisation, the support of our members is crucial!

  description: >
    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
